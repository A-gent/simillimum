Simillimum is a fork of SourceMod. Right now it serves as a playground for those who would like to
contribute to a more open repository. It's not meant to be as a competitor, Simillimum may not be in a
usable state (although we aim to only accept tested changes to the core) and it uses experimental code.
Anyone interested in becoming a contributor should get in touch with Zephyrus. Simillimum will always
maintain ABI compatibility with SourceMod.
